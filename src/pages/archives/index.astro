      Supporting the open-source movement as a non profit Ethereum developer conference, Ethcon Korea have started its
      journey since 2019. We as organizers believe that Ethereum is more than just a technical solution - it is a
      community. <br />
      <br /> Our mission is to empower local communities by bridging the gap between Korea and the world through the promotion
      of decentralized protocols, tools, and culture. Our commitment to fostering innovation and community continues with
      this Hackathon and conference, and we look forward to supporting the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem here.
